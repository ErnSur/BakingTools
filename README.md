This is a repo for editor tools that aim to streamline some of the work that you do with baking light's, Navmesh and OC in Unity.

## Baking Modls

You can create BakingMolds Asset from Create/QuickEye/BakingMolds.
This asset can store object data related to baking, like static flags, lightmap scale and others.
These presets are called molds and can be applied to scene objects by opening Chef Tools Window form BakingMolds inspector.
